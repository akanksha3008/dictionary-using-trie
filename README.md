This C++ program implements dictionary using trie data structure. The tree based data structure, Trie is an efficient way to store set of strings and improves code complexity of the data retrieval system. User can perform operations like insertion and removal of word-meaning pair, searching meaning of word, etc. Autocomplete feature is also added in this dictionary.
